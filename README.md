ToDoList

This is the Android App: ToDoList for the assignment 1.

This app is used to record, archive and email to-do events.

Becasue this is the first android app I build, I got a great inspiration from Student Picker App. And there are many patterns, ideas
and structures I designed in the way Dr.Hindle did in the video. And I also get help from Internet and the reference and credit
will be shown inside my source code.
